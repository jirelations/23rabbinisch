  abstract: >-
    The triad of Jews, Gentiles and Christians seems clearly arranged in the
    religious
     world of the Roman Empire. However, a closer look shows that this is too simple a
     model in that it neither does justice to the diverse descriptions of these groups
     or those of others, nor to their respective concepts of identity or the varying mechanisms
     of inclusions and exclusions. This volume illustrates this by way of interdisciplinary
     individual studies on Asia Minor, but also through conceptional considerations. In
     summary, the editors offer new terminology suggestions

  abstract: >-
    Islam arose in the seventh century in Arabia through the preaching of the
    prophet Muhammad (d. 632). Nineteenth-century Jewish historians of the
    ‘Wissenschaft des Judentums’ school painted the experience of medieval Jewry
    in the world of Islam in idyllic, almost mythic terms and in stark contrast
    to the sorrowful, oppressive, persecutory history of Jews living in medieval
    Christendom. This rosy comparison between the ‘Golden Age’ under Islam and
    the era of persecution under Christendom, sketched against the background of
    the political agenda of nineteenth-century Central European Jewish
    intellectuals, was carried forth into the twentieth century, reinforced by
    the brutal Nazi persecution of the Jews culminating in the Holocaust. On the
    other hand, the Arab-Jewish dispute over Palestine generated a fresh
    political issue which impacted on the historiography of medieval Jewry in
    the world of Islam.

  abstract: >-
    Strictly speaking, the Second Temple period extends from the construction of
    the temple at the end of the sixth century bce to its destruction by the
    Romans in 70 ce. Some scholars would now argue that the entire biblical
    corpus belongs in this period. Even if one accepts the more traditional
    dating of biblical sources, the final edition of the Torah must be placed
    after the Exile. This article deals with this literature. The literature may
    be divided into three categories, based on provenance more than on literary
    genre, although each category has its own characteristics. These are the
    Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha; the Dead Sea scrolls; and the literature of
    the Greek-speaking diaspora. The first and third categories were preserved
    by Christians, the second was only recently recovered from the caves by the
    Dead Sea.

  abstract: >-
    The topic of religious identity in late antiquity is highly contentious. How
    did individuals
     and groups come to ascribe identities based on what would now be known as 'religion',
     categorizing themselves and others with regard to Judaism, Manichaeism, traditional
     Greek and Roman practices, and numerous competing conceptions of Christianity? How
     and why did examples of self-identification become established, activated, or transformed
     in response to circumstances? To what extent do labels (whether ancient and modern)
     for religious categories reflect a sense of a unified and enduring social or group
     identity for those included within them? How does religious identity relate to other
     forms of ancient identity politics (for example, ethnic discourse concerning 'barbarians')?
     0'Rhetoric and Religious Identity in Late Antiquity' responds to the recent upsurge
     of interest in this issue by developing interdisciplinary research between classics,
     ancient and medieval history, philosophy, religion, patristics, and Byzantine studies,
     expanding the range of evidence standardly used to explore these questions. In exploring
     the malleability and potential overlapping of religious identities in late antiquity,
     as well as their variable expressions in response to different public and private
     contexts, it challenges some prominent scholarly paradigms. In particular, rhetoric
     and religious identity are here brought together and simultaneously interrogated to
     provide mutual illumination: in what way does a better understanding of rhetoric (its
     rules, forms, practices) enrich our understanding of the expression of late-antique
     religious identity? How does an understanding of how religious identity was ascribed,
     constructed, and contested provide us with a new perspective on rhetoric at work in
     late antiquity

     come cittadini di una comunità ermeneutica per eccellenza. Tale fu la comunità nata
     ai piedi del Sinai. Ed ermeneutico è appunto il gesto che soppianta con il proselito
     la figura biblica dello straniero, e questo entro il quadro di un'Alleanza ora estesa
     all'intero orizzonte storico e naturale. E di cui la Torah sinaitica è la Carta

  abstract: >-
    This collection of essays from an international group of scholars explores
    how the
     elaboration of biblical prayers of the Persian and early Hellenistic periods shaped
     identity, evoked a sense of belonging to specific groups, and added emotional significance
     to this affiliation. Contributors draw examples from different biblical texts, including
     Genesis, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah, Psalms, Jonah, and Daniel,
     to illustrate the transformation from short, individual prayers to longer theological
     and historical reflections, ritualized recitations, confirmations of hope, prophecy,
     and penitential prayers. Essays approach the texts from different perspectives, showing
     how prayers play a key role in the construction of biblical bboks, how biblical figures
     are charaterized by prayers, and how these prayers shape and modify individual and
     collective identity discourses

  abstract: >-
    For all Jews in this period, in both diaspora and homeland, the Jerusalem
    Temple was the central religious institution. The wide dispersal of Jews
    prevented many from regular participation in Temple worship, but no
    religious Jew seem to have ignored the significance of the sacrificial and
    other offerings in Jerusalem. The second pillar of common Judaism was the
    Torah. It was during these centuries that the biblical text took a form
    resembling that of the present day and acquired something close to its later
    authority. Most of the debate about the relation of Jews to the surrounding
    culture has concentrated on the Hellenization of Judaism. The motivation of
    Christian scholars for investigating the relationship of Judaism and
    Hellenism has naturally been very different and more concerned with the
    origins of ideas found in the early Church.

  abstract: >-
    Classical rabbinic literature comprises all those ancient Jewish literary
    compilations which transmit the traditions of tannaitic (70–200 ce) and
    amoraic (third-to fifth-century ce) rabbis in Palestine and Babylonia: the
    Mishnah, the Tosefta, the Palestinian and the Babylonian Talmud, and various
    midrashim. Accordingly, rabbinic literature must be seen as a collective
    rather than an authorial literature, transmitting a wide variety of partly
    divergent and contradictory views and teachings rather than providing a
    linear systematic outline of a particular individual's point of view. The
    critical study of rabbinic literature began in the nineteenth century with
    the so-called Wissenschaft des Judentums (Science of Judaism), whose
    representatives began to apply to rabbinic texts historical and philological
    methods which were also used in other fields of the humanities. The
    application of methods and theories from related fields such as literary
    theory allows one to see the texts from a new perspective.

  abstract: >-
    The term ‘Judaeo-Arabic’ refers to a type of Arabic that was used by Jews
    and was distinct in some way from other types of Arabic. The Arabic language
    was used by Jews in Arabia before the rise of Islam. From the point of view
    of linguistic form, the following characteristic features of written
    Judaeo-Arabic can be identified: it is written in Hebrew script; it exhibits
    deviations from Classical Arabic; and it contains Hebrew and Aramaic
    elements. ‘Judaeo-Persian’ refers to Persian used by Jews. Like
    Judaeo-Arabic, Judaeo-Persian is not a uniform linguistic entity. The term
    is used to refer to both a written and a spoken form of language. The
    geographical area in which it was used extended beyond the boundaries of
    Iran and included Afghanistan, part of the Caucasus, and much of Central
    Asia. Judaeo-Persian in its written form is represented in Hebrew script.

    "This collection of seven essays draws on work done in 2010. The author
    takes up several topics in the systemic analysis of Judaisms and deals with
    comparisons of Judaisms. The papers include two commentaries on the current
    state of the academic study of Judaism. The reason for periodically
    collecting and publishing essays and reviews is to give them a second life,
    after they have served as lectures or as summaries of monographs or as
    free-standing articles or as expositions of Judaism in collections of
    comparative religions. This re-presentation serves a readership to whom the
    initial presentation in lectures or specialized journals or short-run
    monographs is inaccessible. Some of the essays furthermore provide a précis,
    for colleagues in kindred fields, of fully worked out
    monographs"--Publisher's description, back cover

  abstract: >-
    The papers in this volume were presented at a Mellon-Sawyer Seminar held at
    the University of Oxford in 2009-2010, which sought to investigate side by
    side the two important movements of conversion that frame late antiquity: to
    Christianity at its start, and to Islam at the other end. Challenging the
    opposition between the two stereotypes of Islamic conversion as an
    intrinsically violent process, and Christian conversion as a fundamentally
    spiritual one, the papers seek to isolate the behaviours and circumstances
    that made conversion both such a common and such a contested phenomenon. The
    spread of Buddhism in Asia in broadly the same period serves as an external
    comparator that was not caught in the net of the Abrahamic religions. The
    volume is organised around several themes, reflecting the concerns of the
    initial project with the articulation between norm and practice, the role of
    authorities and institutions, and the social and individual fluidity on the
    ground

    Karaism is best defined as a Jewish religious movement of a scripturalist
    and messianic nature, which crystallized in the second half of the ninth
    century in the areas of Persia-Iraq and Palestine. This article highlights
    new developments and breakthroughs in research, with specific emphasis on
    the state of manuscript sources, and the fields of Karaite history and
    hermeneutics. It also attempts to redefine the major impetus behind the
    Karaite movement. It concludes by reviewing the issues that have been raised
    and outlines the major paradigmatic shift in the current understanding of
    Karaism. Two separate modes of explanation have traditionally been pursued
    in the light of comparative religious phenomena. One identifies the major
    motivation underlying Karaism as intrinsic to Judaism, drawn from earlier
    scripturalist models, and the other identifies it as external to Judaism,
    borrowed or grafted onto it from heterodox Islamic models.

  abstract: >-
    English summary: This is a thorough investigation of the passages about
    Jesus in the rabbinic literature, mainly in the Babylonian Talmud. In his
    lucid and accessible book, Peter Schafer examines how the rabbis read and
    used the New Testament to assert Judaism's superiority over Christianity.
    The Talmudic texts focus on the virgin birth of Jesus, his behavior as a bad
    and frivolous disciple, his teachings, the healing capacities Jesus and his
    disciples possessed, the execution of Jesus and his disciples, and finally
    his punishment forever in hell. The center of this critique of Jesus and his
    fate was Babylonia under Sassanian rule, quite in contrast to Palestinian
    Judaism, which was increasingly threatened by the dominant power of
    Christianity. German description: In seinem neuesten Buch [Jesus im Talmud]
    hat Schafer sich nicht nur als ein grossartiger Erforscher antiker und
    mittelalterlicher judischer Texte erwiesen - das wurde bereits zur Genuge
    demonstriert -, sondern auch als ein talentierter Autor, aus dessen Handen
    der Text fliesst wie das Wasser, mit dem die Rabbinen die Torah verglichen
    haben.Galit Hasan-Rokem in Jewish Quarterly Review 99 (2009), S. 114Schafers
    faszinierende Studie demonstriert meisterhaft, dass der babylonische Talmud
    auf christliche Behauptungen uber Jesus von Nazareth antwortet, [...] dass
    die Uberlieferungen der babylonischen Rabbinen nicht die verqueren
    Phantasien bornierter Rabbinen [...] sind, sondern faszinierende
    Rohdiamanten, kurze und oft brutale Meisterstucke, die historische Lektionen
    von entscheidender Bedeutung mitzuteilen haben.Richard Kalmin in Jewish
    Quarterly Review 99 (2009), S. 112Nicht zuletzt mit der Klarheit in der
    Argumentation lost das Buch [a] den Anspruch Schafers, ein
    allgemeinverstandliches Werk vorzulegen, uberzeugend ein.S.O. in Herder
    Korrespondenz 62 (2008), S. 269Zudem ist sein Werk - gerade in einer Zeit
    aufkommenden religiosen Fundamentalismus - auch fur interessierte Laien mit
    Gewinn zu lesen, bietet es doch Einblicke in die Auseinandersetzungen von
    Spatantike und Fruhmittelalter, die historisch einzuordnen Aufgabe unserer
    Zeit ist, damit ein angemessenes Nebeneinander der Religionen erreicht
    werden kann.Joachim Jeska in Biblische Zeitschrift 52 (2008), S. 297-298

  abstract: >-
    This article presents a narrative history of the Jews between the
    destruction of the Second Temple (70 ce) and the Arab conquest of Palestine
    (c.640 ce). After the destruction, Palestine was made into a standard Roman
    province in a way which at least curtailed the Jews' traditional autonomy.
    Nevertheless, the Jews rebelled again, with disastrous results. The Diaspora
    Revolt (115–17 ce) seems to have ended in the decimation or destruction of
    the Jewish settlements in Egypt, Libya, and several other places, while the
    Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–5) brought an end to the Jews' hopes for the
    restoration of Jerusalem and the Temple and, more tangibly, to Jewish
    settlement in the district of Judaea. The historiography of the past sixty
    years on the Jews in the ‘Talmud period’ can be divided into two very broad
    tendencies, which may be designated Israeli and non-Israeli.
